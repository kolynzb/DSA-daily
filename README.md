# LETS MAKE SOME ALGORITHMS

- This repo contains all my research and activity projects and exercises on _data structures and algorithms_.

# Tips ðŸ˜‰

### Before an Interview

- Understand common data structures and basic funtionality like traversing throught them.
  - Arrays
  - LinkedLists
  - Trees
  - Graphs
  - Heaps
  - tries
- Learn sorting and searching algorithms.
- Practice till your confortable solving problems.
- Don't spend more than 30minutes on a problem.
- Track the problems you have done for future reference.
- Go through blind 75 questions to get the algorithms pattern.
- Mock Interviews

### During Interview

- Repeat the question while drawing out, making sure you understand the question.
- Ask for clarity.
- Get insights by doing examples on the board.
- Describe your approach:Brute force first .
- Code: write code using the breadth-first approach.
- Testing: pass the test cases.
- Optimize: the complexities of the algorithm.
