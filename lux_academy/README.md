# Interview Peparation with a problem solving approach to Algorithms

- A **data structure** is anything that can store data like int , stringsbut some complex data structures which are used to store large and connected data include linked list,tree,graph,stack,queue e.t.c.Note that all those structures allow to perform different operations on data.
- An **Algorithm** is a finite set of instructions or logic, written in order, to accomplish a certain pre

### Characteristic Description

- Data structures can also be classified o the basis of the following characteristics.
  - **Linear**
    - Items are arranged in a linear sequence. _Example :_ Array
  - **Non-linear**
    - Items are not in a sequence _Example :_ Tree,Graph
  - **Homogenous**
    - All elements are of the same type.
  - **Non-homogenous**
    - Not all elements are of the same type.
  - **Static**
    - Those whose sizes and strucutres associated memory locations are
  - **Dynamic**
    - Expand or shrink depanding upon the program need and its requirements

### Every Algorithm must satisfy the following properties:

1. **Input**
   - There should be 0 or more inputs supplied externally to the algorithm.
2. **Output**
   - There should be atleast one output obtained.
3. **Definiteness**
   - Every step of the algorithm should be clear and well defined.(_check out **SOLID** principles_)
4. **Finiteness**
   - Should have a finite number of steps
5. **Correctness**
   - Every step of the algorithm must create a correct output.

- An Algorithm is said to be efficient and fast, if it takes less time to execute and consumes less memory.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Space Complexity**

  - Is the amount of memory space required by the algoritm, during the course of its execution.

- **Time Complexity**
  - Is a way to represent the amount of time required by the program to run till its compiled.

## Tips

- Always ask if you can operate on the assumption that the user has entered valid data or do you have to cast it.
- Constraints

### Before an Interview

- Understand common data structures and basic funtionality like traversing throught them.
  - Arrays
  - LinkedLists
  - Trees
  - Graphs
  - Heaps
  - tries
- Learn sorting and searching algorithms.
- Practice till your confortable solving problems.
- Don't spend more than 30minutes on a problem.
- Track the problems you have done for future reference.
- Go through blind 75 questions to get the algorithms pattern.
- Mock Interviews

### During Interview

- Repeat the question while drawing out, making sure you understand the question.
- Ask for clarity.
- Get insights by doing examples on the board.
- Describe your approach:Brute force first .
- Code: write code using the breadth-first approach.
- Testing: pass the test cases.
- Optimize: the complexities of the algorithm.
